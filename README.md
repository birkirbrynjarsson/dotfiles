# Mac setup and dotfiles
Tools and instructions to speed up and automate my setup and configurations after clean re-installation of MacOS.


## Requirements
MacOS, the following setup has a clean installation in mind.


## Make your own
If you want to make your own setup based on this one I recommend the following steps:

- Fork the repository
- Edit the Brewfile
  - Some apps however are required for later steps (e.g. nerd-font, iTerm2, mas, nvm, neofetch, jq, rbenv, p10k, zsh-*)
- Edit settings.sh to suit your own preferences
- Edit mixin/aliases
  - PS. before you start adding your own aliases I recommend running `alias` and looking at what is already there, a lot of stuff comes with the Oh-My-Zsh plugins.
- Follow the manual setup guide


# Manual Setup
~~Unfortunately~~ it's a manual process, there's no single script that automates everything.  
However that's all splendid, I enjoy going through the steps as well as maintaining this documentation.

Install the **Xcode Command Line Tools**

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Configure Git

```bash
git config --global user.name "Birkir Brynjarsson"  
git config --global user.email "*******@gmail.com"  
git config --global github.user birkirbrynjarsson
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore
```

## Clone the repository
Clone the repository and hide it in Finder with `chflags`

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/birkirbrynjarsson/dotfiles
chflags hidden dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```


## Install Applications

Install [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Allow apps downloaded from anywhere before installing with Brew

```bash
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

Install applications from **Brewfile** and optionally a secondary file, `Brewfile2`

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
brew bundle -v
```

## SSH keys

With **1password** installed I get my **SSH-keys** from saved documents and move to `~/.ssh` and make sure permissions are correct

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

Create `~/.ssh/config` and modify it to automatically load keys into ssh-agent and store passphrases in keychain.

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
# Add to following to the config file
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Add the private key to the `ssh-agent` and store the potential passphrase in the keychain.

```bash
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

If the public **SSH-key** has been added to [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/ssh), the connection can be tested

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

### GPG keys, Github

Setup `~/.gnupg` folder from backup, checkout this [gist](https://gist.github.com/troyfontaine/18c9146295168ee9ca2b30c00bd1b41e) for how to GPG.

```bash
gpg -k --keyid-format LONG # Copy the key for next step
git config --global user.signingkey <KEY>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)
echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
echo "use-agent" > ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
```


## MacOS system preferences

Run `settings.sh` to apply custom preferences for Finder, Menu bar, Dock etc.
> These settings are what is most likely to break as the preferences and corresponding files change between Mac OS versions. To be safe, skip running this script (except the last osascript step in the file that updates the look of terminal.app) and change settings manually.

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x settings.sh
./settings.sh
```


## Make the shell awesome with iTerm2, Zsh, Oh-My-Zsh, Powerlevel10k & neofetch

![iTerm2 Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/NLdVDPS.png "iTerm2 after customization")

Set preferences for iTerm2

```bash
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2.plist PrefsCustomFolder -string "~/dotfiles/iterm2"
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2.plist LoadPrefsFromCustomFolder -bool true
```

Install **[Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)**

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Zsh Profile +

Source the ZSH profile and other config files (optionally restart Terminal/iTerm2 after creating the symlink)

```bash
# Symlink neofetch config and .vimrc
touch ~/.hushlogin
mkdir -p ~/.config/neofetch
ln -svf ~/dotfiles/neofetch/config.conf ~/.config/neofetch/
ln -svf ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/
# Symlink .zshrc
ln -svf ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/
source ~/.zshrc
```

If you get compaudit insecure directories error run:
```bash
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
compaudit | xargs chmod o-w
```


### Ruby and Gems

Install latest Ruby version and `colorls` for colorful `ls` with icons. Aliased to `lc` and `lcc`

```bash
rbenv install $(rbenv install -l | grep -v - | tail -1)
rbenv global $(rbenv install -l | grep -v - | tail -1)
```

Restart your terminal before installing gems

```bash
gem install colorls
```


## Node
Setup Node with nvm

```bash
mkdir ~/.nvm
nvm install --lts
```

Install global packages from `npmfile`

```bash
cat ~/dotfiles/npmfile | xargs -L1 npm i -g > /dev/null
```


## Python
With `pyenv` installed, get the latest version of python

```bash
PYTHON_LATEST=$(pyenv install --list | sed 's/^  //' | grep '^\d' | grep --invert-match 'dev\|a\|b' | tail -1)
PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework"
pyenv install $PYTHON_LATEST
pyenv global $PYTHON_LATEST
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Visual Studio Code settings
I sync plugins and settings to Visual Studio Code with the [*Settings sync*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) plugin. It requires a GitHub API Token with gist access. Check out the [configuration instructions](https://shanalikhan.github.io/2016/07/31/Visual-Studio-code-sync-setting-edit-manually.html). I store my GitHub API Token in a secure note with 1password.

My currently configured plugins can be found with:

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/gists/8b47741d950a86e46222eb8bfc293a9a \
| jq '.files."extensions.json".raw_url' \
| tr -d \" \
| xargs curl -s \
| grep name
```

## openpyn - NordVPN cli

With wget, openvpn and python3 installed using pyenv, install [openpyn](https://github.com/jotyGill/openpyn-nordvpn)
```bash
pip install openpyn
sudo brew services start openvpn
sudo openpyn --init
```


## Dropbox Desktop sync

Sync your Desktop between workstations, further instructions [here](https://www.imore.com/how-sync-your-documents-desktop-and-any-other-folder-dropbox)

```bash
ln -sv ~/Desktop ~/Dropbox/
```


## Private Config files

I keep some config files, shell aliases and application preferences in a [private branch](https://24ways.org/2013/keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-private-on-github/) of this repository and copy them into their designated destination after installing the apps. 
These files might contain Software Licenses, network addresses and other private data.

### Spotify CLI

The `spotify` cli requires configuration.
Add CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to `~/.shpotify.cfg`, get this information by [creating an 'application'](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create).

```bash
echo 'CLIENT_ID="urCl13nt1D"' > ~/.shpotify.cfg
echo 'CLIENT_SECRET="urCl13nt53cret"' >> ~/.shpotify.cfg
```

## Other Software
Here's a list of other software that doesn't have a homebrew package
```
Adobe Lightroom
Adobe Photoshop
Canon EOS Utility
```

## Stay up to date

Run these commands regularly to stay up to date

```bash
# Brew upgrade, update and cleanup
bubu
# npm update
npmu
```

## Credits
Thanks to the [dotfiles community](http://dotfiles.github.io/) and the creators/contributors there. Many of the aliases, settings etc. are borrowed from the repositories found there.
